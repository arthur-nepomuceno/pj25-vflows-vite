## Brief in
   This project is the front-end of an APP for issuing supplier payrolls.
   With a valid and previously registered CNPJ, a company can connect, visualize the available contracts
   and then issue a payroll, with values, date and tax data specifics for each case.
   
***

## Introduction
   This project is built with React (ViteJS), having three screens:
   - Login screen: app's entry screen, where an user must inform the CNPJ of one's company to access further options.
   - Contracts screen: shows the company's main information, along with a list of contracts to issue the payrolls.
   - New Contract screen: shows the selected contract to be fullfilled.
   
   To make use of the app, insert in the main screen any of the following values for the CNPJ:
   - 02.828.446/0001-34
   - 72.610.132/0001-46
   - 01.874.354/0001-28
